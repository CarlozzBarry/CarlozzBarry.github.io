				After the first couple lectures, my group was created. We had our first meeting today, and it was nice. We started just brainstorming about our capacities, and it turns out that two of the components has skills in general coding and Unity, while the other two ones have capabilities in sound design, which may be extremely useful, indeed.

				We had a second meeting in order to put together our knowledge and working out ideas for the game. My main feature for the game was an interesting storyline, which had to be partially put aside, due to the limited amount of time and the main idea agreed for the game itself, which I pretty much liked: a game whose scope is to re-inforest a desertified wasteland, which I liked because it both has many time-spending positive features (personally, it's exactly the kind of game I'd waste my days on), and secondly because it has a <i>milj&ouml-v&aumlnlig</i> feature, which I sometimes find a bit too repeated here in Sweden, nevertheless recognizing its importance; besides, inserting such a feature in a game for sure can allow the game itself to widen its possibilities of spreading, gaining an educational/awareness function as well, in addition to the mere game-y ones.

				We had a second meeting in order to put together our ideas and considerations for the gameplay presentation, which turned out to be a bit below our outcome expectations, simply because we kind of misquoted what the professor asked - we provided a gameplay, whereas a demo was requested. Nevertheless, the concept was appreciated, and we kept working on that. In this phase, I created a desert soundscape, while Nina created a forest one. Our further aim is now to create a 3-D sound, which will constitute for sure a challenging task, but will be extremely satisfying once done - I'm sure of that.
				Unity actually impelements a function which allows such feature with a relatively speaking little effort, nevertheless the effect is impacting, and it shall perform.

				Today's meeting was about properly preparing the presentation for the first status update, which should focuse more on the business, techincal and side issues, rather than on the actual game mechanics and stuff. It actually turned out pretty well, we obtained valuable feedback. In general, I thought that the solutions with which most of the group came up in this presentation were pretty similar to each other, not being this a sign of monotony, rather than an index of how this world seems to follow precise schemes and utilizes specific tools. We also took the idea of another group in terms of managing and stuff: up to now, we used Messenger and Zoom for, respectively, written communication and "vis-a-vis" meetings, but we decided to move on Discord, which is a platform allowing both said features in one, and allows a more comfortable division of channels in referring to different topics - e.g.: one channel is about audio coding, another one about 3-D modeling, and so on. 
				The presentation feedback was valuable and we're working on it, trying to take our best out of it. Our ambitions might be a little too further, nevertheless we'll try to stick to them as long as possible, and maintaining them anyways as our group concept and target.

				A pretty content-filled supervision this morning. My prosecution was keeping to design sounds and try different combinations of them, focusing more on the desertical and environmental soundscape (say, wind, desert, calmness, ecc...). It might require more softwares, even if I just used either sampled sounds or copyright-free audios, and mixed them up with Audacity and similar softwares. However, Nina, which seems way more skilled than me in that sense, is used with working with Wwise, hence I reckon we will stick to that. It could be hard to learn, but I'll try my best on that. On the other side, it's interesting noticing how complicated can be to create a game starting from zero... there is a lot to be discussed, processed, ideated, put down and coded along.

				Synthesizing audio is so intriguing. The desert wind can have tons of shades, as like as sand flowing, and the silence itself is endowed with an incredible power... there isn't much of "mine" in the synthesis, since many of the sounds we are using come from copyright-free sources and they are all very well done, at least in a way I, personally, couldn't replicate, not so faithfully. I had my recorder sent from Italy for maybe getting something similar, but unfortunately it hasn't reached me yet, and it's a pity since it might have helped a lot in this sense. Anyways, working in audio synthesis in a specific way is fine, even if I'm totally new in using these methods (never actually used these sounds, I more focused on composing actual music or MIDI tracks than an actual soundscape).

				Jonas Kjellstr&oumlm's guest lecture was pretty interesting! It gave a broad overview of what one can do in a game firm, and made me realize some things about this world I wasn't exactly aware of. Even if I have a different plan for my life, the idea of working in a game firm might pretty well find room in that, and this conference helped me to realize it. At the current state it's not my first choice, but I can put it in a solid Top-3 of professions. The audio design side still attracts me, even if I'm realizing it's harder than expected, and that embedded techs (like the Wwise we're using) are tougher

				This morning's supervision gave us the final hints in terms of feedback, which we shall use for the project's best outcome's sake. Next week's presentation is coming... 	
				The past weeks were spent working on the whole project. My contribution in terms of audio design was slightly inferior than expected since when we decided to use Wwise for implementing the audio in the game. I honestly had a very hard time in learning how to use such software, which for the other group members turned out pretty easy instead. It was kind of frustrating, then I decided to more focus on helping with the webpage and the GDD. I learned useful hints, though: the soundbank functionalities and the possibilities Wwise offers seem to be countless and yet to be explored, and I ended up pretty frustrated in having such a hard time in getting it to work. Anyways, for the sake of the final outcome of the whole thing, I shall contribute "with the nails and the teeth" (old saying which should be of hard comprehension for not-Italian speaking people, just say it indicates the accomplishment of something with any possible mean). This said, I'm satisfied with what I learned within the course, and I know I'm learned something that, even if it, at the moment, is unlikely to constitute the most part of my future, will always turn out useful and enriching.

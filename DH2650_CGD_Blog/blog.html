				After the first couple lectures, my group was created. We had our first meeting today, and it was nice. We started just brainstorming about our capacities, and it turns out that two of the components has skills in general coding and Unity, while the other two ones have capabilities in sound design, which may be extremely useful, indeed.

				We had a second meeting in order to put together our knowledge and working out ideas for the game. My main feature for the game was an interesting storyline, which had to be partially put aside, due to the limited amount of time and the main idea agreed for the game itself, which I pretty much liked: a game whose scope is to re-inforest a desertified wasteland, which I liked because it both has many time-spending positive features (personally, it's exactly the kind of game I'd waste my days on), and secondly because it has a <i>milj&ouml-v&aumlnlig</i> feature, which I sometimes find a bit too repeated here in Sweden, nevertheless recognizing its importance; besides, inserting such a feature in a game for sure can allow the game itself to widen its possibilities of spreading, gaining an educational/awareness function as well, in addition to the mere game-y ones.

				We had a second meeting in order to put together our ideas and considerations for the gameplay presentation, which turned out to be a bit below our outcome expectations, simply because we kind of misquoted what the professor asked - we provided a gameplay, whereas a demo was requested. Nevertheless, the concept was appreciated, and we kept working on that. In this phase, I created a desert soundscape, while Nina created a forest one. Our further aim is now to create a 3-D sound, which will constitute for sure a challenging task, but will be extremely satisfying once done - I'm sure of that.

				Today's meeting was about properly preparing the presentation for the first status update, which should focuse more on the business, techincal and side issues, rather than on the actual game mechanics and stuff. It actually turned out pretty well, we obtained valuable feedback. In general, I thought that the solutions with which most of the group came up in this presentation were pretty similar to each other, not being this a sign of monotony, rather than an index of how this world seems to follow precise schemes and utilizes specific tools. We also took the idea of another group in terms of managing and stuff: up to now, we used Messenger and Zoom for, respectively, written communication and "vis-a-vis" meetings, but we decided to move on Discord, which is a platform allowing both said features in one, and allows a more comfortable division of channels in referring to different topics - e.g.: one channel is about audio coding, another one about 3-D modeling, and so on. 
				The presentation feedback was valuable and we're working on it, trying to take our best out of it. Our ambitions might be a little too further, nevertheless we'll try to stick to them as long as possible, and maintaining them anyways as our group concept and target.

			<p style=" text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 1.75em; font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana;">
This study will investigate how the
expressive quality emotion in a music
excerpt can be associated to different colors.
Research has shown that music can induce
different emotions depending on acoustical
features such as pitch, tempo and timbre.
Other studies have shown that colors can be
associated with emotions, and that people
tend to match color association with the
perceived emotion in music. In this study, a
test was conducted were 12 participants got
to rate how well 24 colors of different hue,
saturation and brightness was associated
with 8 music excerpts of jazz music. The
test was conducted using a form were 8
colors was shown at once together with a
slider for rating. The music was played
through headphones in randomized order in
between the participants. The results shows
that some hues are rated significantly higher
than others for different emotions, meaning
that different hues are associated with
different emotions. Further, a correlation
was found between some emotions and the
color property brightness.

REMAKE<br>~~~~~~~~~~</h1>

				<p style=" text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 1.75em; font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana;">
We took inspiration from an audio-based installation to
design a virtual installation using virtual reality software
and experiment with sound interaction within this medium.
While plenty of research exists on the topics of use of audio
in virtual reality and use of body motion to modulate
sounds, not much can be found about the combination of
these two aspects, via the use of a head-mounted display
paired with motion controllers. We designed a prototype
in which the user can create their own installation and interact
with it, and mapped most of the available interaction
to sound modulations such as pitch and gain. Audio was
also spatialized based on the position of the objects and the
head. While we were not able to test the prototype extensively
with users, we found that it enabled for unexpected
combinations of different interactions, and that audio spatialization
plays a big part in how this virtual environment
can be perceived and interacted with. While the prototype
might not be a substitute for a physical installation, it nevertheless
highlighted the novel ways in which audio can be
interacted with in VR.

		<div>
				<p style=" text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 1.75em; font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana;">
Active music listening has shown to be beneficial for improving
listening enjoyment in both hearing persons and
persons with hearing loss. With this paper we present
the process behind the development and pilot testing of an
audio game where the user, through goal oriented music
listening tasks, is required to listen actively in order to succeed
with the tasks.
The game, Sonic Gesture Challenge was created for web
deployment, intended for use on handheld devices, using
JS (JavaScript) and WebAudioXML, a recently released
JS library developed by Hans Lindetorp, in which XML
syntax is used for WebAudio applications. Each of the
seven authors created a sound design to go with the game.
All sound designs were tested in a pilot study, with the goal
of assessing the feasibility of the implementation method,
and gaining some understanding of what goes into an enjoyable,
yet challenging ’enough’ sound design, aiming to
support the experience of active listening.
In the game interface, the user is met with a goal oriented
music listening tasks built for active listening. The
user is first asked to listen to a prerecorded sound and then,
by moving their finger within a touch area, recreate the
sound. Different movements on the touch area create different
sounds, depending on the characteristics of the different
sound designs. Through this gestural controlling and
interaction with the sound, the user is required to actively
and mindfully notice any small changes in the sound and
adjust their gesture accordingly in order to obtain a match
and succeed the task.

			<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Acme;">THE SONIFYING HOURGLASS: HACK OF AN OFFICE GADGET FOR SONIFICATION OF AIR POLLUTION<br>~~~~~~~~~~</h1>
			<p style=" text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 1.75em; font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana;">
				The air quality inside an office can constitute an issue: a too high concentration of carbon dioxyde
in a closed environment can harm the wellness of an office worker. This study’s aim is finding a
way to prevent this unpleasant situation, using, as a mean to make a user realise such air pollution
condition, the sonification. For better suit this idea in an office-y context, it was chosen to hack an
object which could be part of an office. For this study’s sake, the chosen office gadget is a hourglass,
firstly since it is an object whose user interaction constitutes a compromise between the typical one of
the constantly used office device and the one which is had with a mere office ornament, and, secondly,
due to practical issues in terms of creation of the object itself and of implementing the sonifying
elements from the scratch.
